# [3075. Maximize Happiness of Selected Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-happiness-of-selected-children)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given an array <code>happiness</code> of length <code>n</code>, and a <strong>positive</strong> integer <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>There are <code>n</code> children standing in a queue, where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> child has <strong>happiness value</strong> <code>happiness[i]</code>. You want to select <code>k</code> children from these <code>n</code> children in <code>k</code> turns.</p>

<p>In each turn, when you select a child, the <strong>happiness value</strong> of all the children that have <strong>not</strong> been selected till now decreases by <code>1</code>. Note that the happiness value <strong>cannot</strong> become negative and gets decremented <strong>only</strong> if it is positive.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> sum of the happiness values of the selected children you can achieve by selecting </em><code>k</code> <em>children</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> happiness = [1,2,3], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can pick 2 children in the following way:
- Pick the child with the happiness value == 3. The happiness value of the remaining children becomes [0,1].
- Pick the child with the happiness value == 1. The happiness value of the remaining child becomes [0]. Note that the happiness value cannot become less than 0.
The sum of the happiness values of the selected children is 3 + 1 = 4.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> happiness = [1,1,1,1], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can pick 2 children in the following way:
- Pick any child with the happiness value == 1. The happiness value of the remaining children becomes [0,0,0].
- Pick the child with the happiness value == 0. The happiness value of the remaining child becomes [0,0].
The sum of the happiness values of the selected children is 1 + 0 = 1.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> happiness = [2,3,4,5], k = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can pick 1 child in the following way:
- Pick the child with the happiness value == 5. The happiness value of the remaining children becomes [1,2,3].
The sum of the happiness values of the selected children is 5.
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><code>1 &lt;= n == happiness.length &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
    <li><code>1 &lt;= happiness[i] &lt;= 10<sup>8</sup></code></li>
    <li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= n</code></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Solutions

### **Approach 1: Greedy + Sorting**

To maximize the sum of happiness values, we should prioritize selecting children with higher happiness values. Therefore, we can sort the children in descending order by happiness value, and then select $k$ children in sequence. For the current $i$-th child, the happiness value obtained is $\max(\textit{happiness}[i] - i, 0)$. Finally, return the sum of happiness values of these $k$ children.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n + k)$, and the space complexity is $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array $\textit{happiness}$.

<p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> $O(n \times \log n + k)$</p>
<p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> $O(\log n)$</p>

class Solution {
    public void reverse(int[] arr) {
		int temp;
        
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i++) {
            temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[arr.length - 1 - i];
            arr[arr.length - 1 - i] = temp;
        }
    }
    
    public long maximumHappinessSum(int[] happiness, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(happiness);
        reverse(happiness);
        
        long ans = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            ans += Math.max(0, happiness[i] - i);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
