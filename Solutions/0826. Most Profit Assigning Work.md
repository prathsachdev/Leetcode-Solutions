# [826. Most Profit Assigning Work](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work)

## Description

<p>You have <code>n</code> jobs and <code>m</code> workers. You are given three arrays: <code>difficulty</code>, <code>profit</code>, and <code>worker</code> where:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>difficulty[i]</code> and <code>profit[i]</code> are the difficulty and the profit of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> job, and</li>
    <li><code>worker[j]</code> is the ability of <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> worker (i.e., the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most <code>worker[j]</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Every worker can be assigned <strong>at most one job</strong>, but one job can be <strong>completed multiple times</strong>.</p>

<ul>
    <li>For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays <code>$1</code>, then the total profit will be <code>$3</code>. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is <code>$0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
<strong>Output:</strong> 100
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><code>n == difficulty.length</code></li>
    <li><code>n == profit.length</code></li>
    <li><code>m == worker.length</code></li>
    <li><code>1 &lt;= n, m &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
    <li><code>1 &lt;= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Solutions

### **Approach 1: Sorting + Two Pointers**

We can sort the jobs in ascending order of ability, and then sort the jobs in ascending order of difficulty.

Then we traverse the workers. For each worker, we find the job with the maximum profit that he can complete, and then add this profit to the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n + m \times \log m)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of the arrays `profit` and `worker` respectively.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfitAssignment(int[] difficulty, int[] profit, int[] worker) {
        int n = profit.length;
        
        List<Pair<Integer, Integer>> jobs = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            jobs.add(new Pair<>(difficulty[i], profit[i]));
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(worker);
        Collections.sort(jobs, Comparator.comparing(Pair::getKey));
        
        int ans = 0, mx = 0, i = 0;
        for (int w : worker) {
            while (i < n && jobs.get(i).getKey() <= w) {
                mx = Math.max(mx, jobs.get(i).getValue());
                ++i;
            }
            
            ans += mx;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
